# Behavior Cloning Analysis Project

This project investigates how the **quantity** and **quality** of expert demonstrations influence the performance of Behavior Cloning (BC) in reinforcement learning environments. Experiments are conducted using **CartPole-v1** and **LunarLander-v2** from OpenAI Gym, focusing on how filtered (high-reward) and unfiltered (mixed-quality) expert data affect imitation performance.
